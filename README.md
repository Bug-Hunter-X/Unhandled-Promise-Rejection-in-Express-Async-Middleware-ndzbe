This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous middleware.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, where an error in an asynchronous operation is silently swallowed. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct way to handle such errors, providing a more robust and user-friendly experience.  The error handling is crucial for production environments to prevent unexpected crashes and provide informative error messages to clients.
